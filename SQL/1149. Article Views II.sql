This table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
 

Write a solution to find all the people who viewed more than one article on the same date.

Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
